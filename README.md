# Anton_Team_Management_System

## Introduce

A swing application about management of Group Play in DNF.

This is my first swing application for study java swing. About why I made it, there is a lot to say.

In DNF, there is a game mode for multiplayer at most 20 to kill a huge turtle. The huge turtle is atrocity so that every team need a commander to schedule members.

At first, I used **txt** to schedule member, but then I thought it crude. So I tried **excel**. As amount of members increased, and one may be have multiple roles, so it propeled me to make a management system. Finally it born.
